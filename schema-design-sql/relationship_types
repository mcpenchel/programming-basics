The relationship types that we have on a relation database are:

A) 1-N: One to Many. For example, a user has many telephones..
  So on this case, we would have two tables: users and telephones.
  And on the telephones table, we would have the column user_id

  So, if X has many Y, we will have x_id on the Y table

B) 1-1: One to One. For example, a company has one boss.
  So in this case, we would have two tables: users and bosses.
  If it's one to one, you have to choose:
    - users table will have the boss_id column
    OR
    - bosses table will have the user_id column

  For 1-1 relationships, it doesn't matter.

C) N-N: Many to Many. For example, a doctor has many patients,
  and a patient has many doctors. For this to work, two tables
  are not enough.. We need a third one.
  So what we have here is: patients, doctors and consultations
  And the consultations table will have both patient_id and
  doctor_id
